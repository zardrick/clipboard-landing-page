## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (Sass)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my skills in **Sass (SCSS)** and **responsive design**. One key takeaway was managing spacing and layout effectively for different screen sizes. Hereâ€™s an example of a helpful mixin I created:

```scss
@mixin tablet {
  @media (max-width: 850px) {
    @content;
  }
}
```

This helped me adjust styling specifically for tablet-sized screens efficiently.

### Continued development

Going forward, I want to:

- Improve my efficiency with **Sass mixins and functions**
- Work more on **accessibility** in future projects

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - My go-to reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped clarify some flexbox concepts.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Great place for feedback and learning from other developers.
